ABSTRACT = {The demand for computing power has been growing exponentially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This growth requires unconventional computing primitives that prioritize energy efficiency, while also addressing the critical need for scalability. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological brain, offers a transformative paradigm for addressing these challenges. This review paper provides an overview of advancements in 2D spintronics and device architectures designed for neuromorphic applications, with a focus on techniques such as spin-orbit torque, magnetic tunnel junctions, and skyrmions. Emerging van der Waals materials like CrI3, Fe3GaTe2, and graphene-based heterostructures have demonstrated unparalleled potential for integrating memory and logic at the atomic scale. This work highlights technologies with ultra-low energy consumption (0.14 fJ/operation), high switching speeds (sub-nanosecond), and scalability to sub-20 nm footprints. It covers key material innovations and the role of spintronic effects in enabling compact, energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, providing a foundation for advancing scalable, next-generation computing architectures.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a Natural Language Processing approach for the in-depth study of ancient Greek literature. Specifically, our project mines the largest data collection of ancient Greek literature to extract descriptive words and their contextual collocations. We then present the Python libraries developed to perform sentiment analysis with a focus on words about gender, race, religion, ethnicity, and other distinguishable characteristics and how they were used by Greek authors. Finally, we showcase some initial findings as a proof of concept.},
