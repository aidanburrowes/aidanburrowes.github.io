Hello! My name is Aidan Burrowes, and I'm an incoming senior at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/), majoring in Computer Science with minors in Physics and Electrical Engineering. My interests span Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, and Software Engineering. Currently, my research involves developing scalable spintronic architectures for neuromorphic and quantum computing with the [Quantum Electronics and Spintronics Innovations](https://wu.ece.ufl.edu/members/) group, as well as fine-tuning language models for Latin syntax with the [Data-Driven Humanities Research Group](https://classics.ufl.edu/data-driven-humanities-research-group/).

Previously, I interned at [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/home.html), enhancing multimodal LLMs and speech-to-text accuracy for Teams meetings, and at HumanAI, building a Flutter app integrating robotic chef technology. This summer, I'm at [Roblox](https://corp.roblox.com/) optimizing CI/CD pipelines and concurrently exploring agentic AI with LLMs via MCP at the [UF College of Medicine](https://prismap.medicine.ufl.edu/).
